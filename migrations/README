## Project Overview

Solar lighting is becoming increasingly important as more people seek sustainable and cost-effective energy solutions. In many regions, particularly in rural and off-grid areas, access to reliable and affordable lighting is a significant challenge. Traditional lighting methods, such as kerosene lamps, are not only expensive but also pose health risks due to smoke and potential fire hazards. Solar lighting offers a clean, renewable, and economical alternative, providing much-needed lighting to households, businesses, and public spaces.

To address this need, RayGen Solar Solutions is a web application dedicated to solar lighting solutions. This platform will enable customers to explore various solar lighting products, understand their benefits, and make informed purchasing decisions. Additionally, it will assist the company in managing their inventory, tracking orders, and offering customer support through user reviews.

## Problem Statement

Currently, many solar lighting providers struggle with manual processes that hinder their ability to efficiently manage inventory, track sales, and provide timely customer support. Customers often lack access to comprehensive information about available solar lighting products, making it challenging for them to choose the best options for their needs. As a result, the adoption of solar lighting solutions is slower than it could be, leaving many without access to this sustainable technology.

RayGen Solar Solutions aims to resolve these issues by centralizing information about solar lighting products, streamlining the sales process, and providing a platform for customer support. By leveraging this technology, customers can easily access the information and products they need.
